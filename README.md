# Predicting-Car-Prices
In this project a machine learning workflow has been created to predict a car's market price using its attributes. The data set contains information on various cars. For each car we have information about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, how fast the car accelerates, and more.
